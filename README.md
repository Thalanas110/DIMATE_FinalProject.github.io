# DIMATE Final Project Documentation

## Purpose and Motivation

This project was created as the **final project** for the **CSC111** course, showcasing the culmination of various programming skills learned throughout the course. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in both high-level web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript) and low-level performance optimization techniques (Assembly). The project serves as a comprehensive example of integrating different technologies to build a responsive, performant, and interactive website.

The professor for this course is Ms. Haidee Hidocos.

## Project Structure

### File Breakdown:
1. **index.html**: The main entry point for the web application, containing the structure and layout of the page.
2. **styles.css**: Contains the styling for the website, ensuring responsiveness and visual appeal.
3. **scripts.js**: The JavaScript code that powers interactive features on the website.
4. **assembly/** (folder): Contains files related to assembly programming, possibly for lower-level performance optimizations.
5. **typescript/** (folder): TypeScript code that provides additional functionality or static type-checking for the project.
6. **assets/**: Includes images, fonts, and other static files necessary for the website.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The project is designed to be fully responsive, with specific instructions to optimize the experience for desktop at 85% screen size.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes dynamic interactions using JavaScript and TypeScript for a more engaging user experience.
- **Optimized Performance**: Uses assembly code for performance-critical parts of the project, ensuring smooth and fast execution.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup language for the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling language used for layout and visual presentation.
- **JavaScript**: Scripting language used for interactivity.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript, providing static typing.
- **Assembly**: Low-level programming language used for performance optimization.
