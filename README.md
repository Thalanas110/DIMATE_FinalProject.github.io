Readme sucks so here.

Hi ma'am Haidee!
I deliberately hosted the site to be able to prove the overtaking schemes I have done not only in the Intro to Computing subject, but also in other subjects like PCTroub and Programming 1, both having decades of now-rusty experience.

Four languages are involved in this project:
HTML5
CSS
JavaScript
-----------
Assembly

This site could be opened on both mobile and the windows/mac/linux. But, be aware that the site requires 85% viewing for desktop. Mobile site may not work that well too.

Thank you.
